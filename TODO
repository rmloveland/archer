** DONE add user groups and permissioning

** DONE add support for conditional text based on user type

** DONE add table of contents to pages

** DONE show currently logged-in user

** DONE fix breakage if user or password doesn't exist

** DONE fix user-level permissioning bug in `view_entry`

    + specifically: we can have two pages with the same name, which is
      nice.  however, currently, the sql in `view_entry` only searches
      on page title and doesn't take into account the user group.  this
      manifests as a user who is only a member of `console_users` being
      able to see a wiki page which is one of two with the same name
      which is permissioned for users in the `publisher_users`
      group. (expected behavior: they only see the page with that title
      that is permissioned for the `console_users` group.)

** TODO add source highlighting (pygments?)

** TODO make sure it works with python 3? (by 2020 at least!)

** TODO choose an OSS license

** TODO implement an 'export wiki' button

    + this will let users download the static directory with all of the
      markdown files (and hg repo) as a tarball.

** TODO full-text search (whoosh? or just use sqlite?)

** TODO fix admin-level permissioning bug in `view_entry`

    + admin users will see pages with the same title listed twice (which
      is expected).  however, when the admin user clicks on one of the
      links, she is always taken to the first result in the array of
      results returned by the db.
