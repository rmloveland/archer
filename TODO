TODO
====

+ [ ] add source highlighting (pygments?)

+ [ ] make sure it works with python 3? (by 2020 at least!)

+ [X] add user groups and permissioning

+ [X] add support for conditional text based on user type

+ [X] add table of contents to pages

+ [ ] choose an OSS license

+ [ ] full-text search (whoosh? or just use sqlite?)

+ [X] show currently logged-in user

+ [X] fix breakage if user or password doesn't exist

+ [ ] fix permissioning bug in `view_entry`
  + specifically: we can have two pages with the same name, which is nice.  however, currently, the sql in `view_entry` only searches on page title and doesn't take into account the user group.  this manifests as a user who is only a member of `console_users` being able to see a wiki page which is one of two with the same name which is permissioned for users in the `publisher_users` group. (expected behavior: they only see the page with that title that is permissioned for the `console_users` group.)
