- fix permissioning bug in `view_entry`
  - specifically: we can have two pages with the same name, which is nice.  however, currently, the sql in `view_entry` only searches on page title and doesn't take into account the user group.  this manifests as a user who is only a member of `console_users` being able to see a wiki page which is one of two with the same name which is permissioned for users in the `publisher_users` group. (expected behavior: they only see the page with that title that is permissioned for the `console_users` group.)
